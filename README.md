# FlapPyBird - Open Source Project Presentation

## üê§ About the Project

**FlapPyBird** is a Python implementation of the popular mobile game **Flappy Bird**, using the **Pygame** library. Originally developed by [sourabhv](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird), it aims to recreate the side-scrolling, single-button gameplay where the player controls a bird trying to fly between sets of pipes.

- **Project Repository (Original)**: [https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird)
- **Forked Repository (Our Work)**: *[insert your forked repo link here]*

## üéØ Objectives of the Game

- Simulate gravity-driven vertical motion for a bird.
- Generate obstacles (pipes) at regular intervals with gaps at random heights.
- Create continuous side-scrolling gameplay with collision detection.
- Keep track of score based on how many pipes the bird passes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- pygame (`pip install pygame`)

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the forked repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlapPyBird.git
cd FlapPyBird

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game
python flappybird.py
```

> Note: The game runs in a GUI window. Press the **Spacebar** to make the bird flap.

## üß† Basic Working of the Game

### Core Mechanics

- The bird automatically falls due to gravity.
- Pressing space makes the bird flap upward.
- Pipes move from right to left.
- The game ends if the bird hits the ground or a pipe.
